# Hello Friend.

I'm Jordan, a software developer and technical skills coach from Manchester, UK. In regards to personal projects, I work mainly with Python and have a vast interest in automation, machine learning and cyber security.

Professionally, I provide support and guidance to software development students and apprentices (mainly focussed on learning JavaScript and full-stack development).
